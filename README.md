# Aishwarya Parackal . Jarvis Consulting

I am a new graduate, a masters in Electrical and Computer Engineering with an emphasis on electronics.  A year of hands-on experience in research, and experimental work in semiconductor fabrication - a sound background in microelectronics and VLSI technology. Also, interested and enjoys programming and experience with C, C++, Java, Python, SQL, Linux, and Verilog. Data Engineering allows exploring my interests along with analyzing data to answer some of the difficult questions or to make critical decisions which might be considered tedious and challenging. However, the fact that it can aid to change life for better excites me the most about Data Engineering. I am a highly motivated, productive and focused team player with a strong communication, interpersonal, organizational, analytical and problem-solving skills: a good listener, hard worker, and avid learner. Moreover, I like to enjoy music, Bharatnatyam, badminton and table-tennis as hobbies.

## Development Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_aishwarya](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_aishwarya)

- **[Cluster Monitor](./linux_sql)**: Implemented a Cluster Monitor Agent that allows users to monitors nodes connected in a Linux cluster by tracking and recording resources usage in realtime to an RDBMS Database. Coded using a bash script and SQL, docker usage for PostgreSQL execution, holding a database with recorded data, crontab set up to record usage data every minute.
- **[Core Java Apps](./core_java)**: Implemented Java-based apps and managed using maven - Grep app that searches and outputs a text pattern in a given directory recursively. Coded using regex, Java I/O, lambda and stream APIs. JDBC app that establishes a connection between java application and RDBMS for SQL execution. Its implementation included DAO and Repository design pattern. The Twitter app allows to post, show and delete tweets. Implemented using spring framework for class dependencies management, twitter REST API, Http client libraries, JSON serialization/deserialization and tested with JUnit and Mockito.
- **[SpringBoot App](./springboot)**: In-progress
- **[Cloud & DevOps](./cloud_devops)**: Not started
- **[Hadoop](./hadoop)**: Not started
- **[Spark/Scala](./spark)**:  Not started
